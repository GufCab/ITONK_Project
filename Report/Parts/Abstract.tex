A DNS server is the fundamental "phonebook" of the internet, enabling the lookup of human-readable URL's to actual IP addresses of resources on the internet. For this to work, known servers can be queried for information about the address of a resource. However, some servers are better than others for speed/location. Other factors like DNS caching, also play a role in choosing an optimal DNS server.

In this report, Google namebench is used to find the optimal DNS resolver server for the individual PC's. A BIND server is set up on local machines, to act as the initial DNS forwarder for resolving DNS queries. 
The local BIND server is then setup with caching and to forward queries to the optimal DNS server. 

All this results in an optimized DNS queries and the results are positive, that especially caching gives a noticeable speedup of subsequent DNS queries. 

A final conclusion on the usefulness and problems of setting up a BIND server is included in the final part of the report.
