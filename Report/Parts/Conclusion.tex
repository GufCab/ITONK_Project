\section{Discussion}
In this project, we have investigated the possibilities and challenges of setting up a DNS forwarding server (BIND). This has been done from the perspective of an imaginary real-life case. 

A gradual approach, where we first found a fitting DNS name-server and then configured the BIND server to forward DNS requests to this server. 

We have achieved results within our expectation; caching reduces the DNS lookup time in subsequent queries. 

\section{Conclusion}
To conclude, we achieved the desired results. 

We have configured a BIND server to listen on localhost and setup a Linux box to resolve DNS queries through the localhost interface. 
This was done fairly easily and it is definitely within the realm of possibilities to setup a DNS resolver for anyone, managing any type of network. 

Google Namebench was used to determine an optimal DNS name-server. Using this, more optimal server, gave a definite boost of
