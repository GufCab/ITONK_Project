\section{BIND DNS server}

\section{Setup of BIND server}
\subsection{Choose DNS server to forward to}
Using namebench etc.

\section{Tests}
After setting up BIND to act as a forwarding DNS server, we must test to see if it actually worked!

To test this, we will use the \textit{dig} tool, to check that the forwarding works, and that caching has a noticeable effect on the DNS look up times. 
\subsection{dig tool}
To test DNS look up times, the Domain Information Groper is invoked in the command line.

This will give us the query time and the forwarding server, used in the query where

\textbf{Query time}
Denotes the time (in ms) it took to resolve the name into an IP address.
This query time should go down considerably on repeated attempts as a result of caching DNS resolutions.

and

\textbf{SERVER}
Denotes the DNS forwarding server used. This should be the address of the BIND server (127.0.0.1, as this server is checking on the localhost interface)

\section{Results}

%This chapter should contain an in-depth description of prototyping
%with the technology, i.e. DNS, DDS, or RMI. That is, you analyze,
%design, implement, and test
%\begin{itemize}
%\item a very limited, but functional prototype that utilizes the
%  technology under consideration.
%\end{itemize}

%You define your own prototype and the context in which it should
%function; the list below is for your inspiration.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Domain Name System: A public school or a medium sized company
%  would like to host their own DNS and/or forward requests to OpenDNS.
%\item Data Distribution Service: A hospital or a production factory
%  would like to employ Connext DDS to distribute mission critical
%  data.
%\item Java Remote Method Invocation: A company is setting up
% facilities, e.g. parcel or luggage sorters, abroad and would like to
%  be able to access back-end methods and data at home.
%\end{itemize}

%In your analysis you should at least address and/or include

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Overall diagram and description of the prototype
%\item Relevance of the technology under consideration to your prototype
%item How the technology is included in your prototype
%\item Definition of a small set of realistic use-cases and related
%  functional requirements
%\end{itemize}

%The design, implementation, and test should at least address and/or include:

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Diagrams, e.g. UML, supplemented with code snippets of most important parts
%\item Test and evaluation of your system: Does it work as intended?
%\item Evaluation of the prototype and the technology employment as a
%  whole
%\end{itemize}
