\chapter{[Case Name]}
\section{Description}
This is a brief description of the case, chosen to illustrate the possibilities and challenges of setting up ypur own DNS server.

\textbf{The case is}
a kindergarten in Hellerup, Denmark has chosen to buy every third child an iPad Air 128 GB Wifi model. The rest of the kids get an Android Nexus 10, 32 GB Wifi model. Everything is going great until Christian, a 3 year old, gets fed up with absurdly long loading times. Christian checks out Google namebench and notices that all his DNS lookups take more than 100 ms!

Christian takes Uffe, the kindergarten teacher, by the hand and informs him of the problem. Uffe quickly realises, that the DNS lookup times could benefit from going to a more appropriate DNS server. To solve this problem for ALL the children, Uffe must find an appropriate DNS server, configure a local DNS server to forward to this server and configure the local DNS server for optimal caching.
