{Conclusion}
\section{Discussion and Results}
The results of working with the case are seen under "Tests". It is seen, that a basic system for distributing messages has been implemented using the Connext Middleware. 

Quality of Service parameters have been setup programatically. This makes it necessary to hardcode the parameters in the Java program. This made for easy testing and prototyping. However, a method of reading QoS parameters from XML files, is included in the technology. This could have been used for setting the QoS.

The given case required to distribute messages for different topics and receive them again in different subscribers.

\section{Conclusion}
We ended up with a working prototype for an office messaging system that implements DDS for seamless connection between all the systems that uses the program.
The program was able to send and receive messages based on a topic that is injected in to the publisher or subscriber.

We have thereby achieved our goal of implementing a working distributed system.

\section{Perspectives}
The prototype in this project did not implement custom data types and XML QoS profiles. In a further implementation, these technologies should be used. Specific types could be used to fully utilize the technology of RTI Connext middleware and object oriented programming.
