\section{Conclusion}
We ended up with a working prototype for an office messaging system that implements DDS for seamless connection between all the systems that uses the program.
The program was able to send and receive messages based on a topic that is injected in to the publisher or subscriber.

We have thereby achieved our goal of implementing a working distributed system.
