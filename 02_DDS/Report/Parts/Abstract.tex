Larger systems often contain several different entities. These entities can assume very varied roles in the system but often have a need to communicate with each other. This can be done implicitly when the entities are on the same machine, but what about when the program runs on 10 different computers?

This report describes the process of setting up middleware (RTI Connext) to distribute messages between different entities in a system to enable a large office environment to pass messages between co-workers. To get an understanding of the subject matter, the theory behind DDS (Data Distribution Service) and Middleware is thoroughly described in the report. 

A prototype is written in Java, using the RTI Connext API. This prototype shows the use of Domains, Topics and DataReader/Writer classes in a basic example. 

The result is a simple implementation, using DDS Middleware, showing how easy it is, to solve a relatively complex problem of message distribution.
