\chapter{Introduction}
In the workplace as well as in distributed systems, sometimes for everything to glide along smoothly, a leader is needed. 
The leader can have the responsibility to distribute work, to access a single resource or something similar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

In a distributed system consisting of several different nodes running in separate processes on separate machines, all dependent on a single leader, it is fatal error if the leader goes down. Therefore a mechanism needs to exist for the system to elect a new leader, without interference from an outside user. 

Several different approaches for electing a leader exist. This report will focus in two; the Bully Algorithm and the Ring Algorithm. 

To explore these leader election algorithms, the Java Remote Method Invocation framework (Java RMI) is used for implementing nodes to run in separate processes on separate Linux machines.
