\section{Perspectives}
Working prototypes for the different leader election implementations has been created at a very basic level. In perspective, a more dynamic approach to the number of Nodes should be used. In a real system, it would be very important to have it be possible for a dynamic number of nodes to be in the system. 

Using this approach would additionally reduce the amount of unnecessary/lost messages between Nodes during leader election.
