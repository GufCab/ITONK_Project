\section{Conclusion}
Java Remote Procedure Calls is a powerful tool. We have created a system that is completely object orientated and operates solely over a network interface, using Java RMI. The system is design around a leader synchronization which allows for serialized access to databases and similar utilities by objects. We have created a very robust design by introducing different leader election algorithms, which works across the network by using the Java Remote Procedure Calls.
This design also introduces some limitations. For example the system will only work in a Java context, and also introduces a huge overhead through RMI and the necessary continuous leaderelection.
